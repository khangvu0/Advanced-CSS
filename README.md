# Hello R2H Coding Grader!

This is my submission for the `Guided Inquiry - Advanced CSS (week 4)` assignment. 

## Why I deserve a 4

I deserve a 4 because I have met all project requirements and tackled challenges in multiple ways. I have implemented 3 different methods in creating the checkerboard, a table full of divs, just using a table, and just using divs. For my methodology on the flag challenge, I challenged myself to approach the flag using one table, self-teaching myself rowspan and colspan. I am most proud of myself for the way I completed the product grid challenge. I faced many stumps and utilized the inspect tools such as cursor select element and the flexbox editor to troubleshoot. I have also implemented Materialize, creating a navbar for each challenge and even figuring out how to troubleshoot the new problems created from adding the Materialize CSS file in my .html files. I have used problem solving in the entirety of this assignment and have learned something new along each step of the way. Over the course of this assignment, I have become more comfortable with advanced CSS techniques and responsive web design.
